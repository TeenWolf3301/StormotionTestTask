# StormotionTestTask
 
 A simple Kotlin Android app made for Stormotion as a test task.

 - ViewModel
 - RecyclerView

## Summary

 It was interesting to work on the app. As a new experience I learned how to use Mockaroo Api. In the application itself I tried to follow MVVM architecture. As part of the task, I didn't implement Google AdMod, and also all data comes in one API request to ListFragment and passed as a Parceble argument to DetailsFragment.
